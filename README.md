# honeytrap

Honeytrap is a low-interaction honeypot and network security tool written to catch attacks against TCP and UDP services. In its default configuration, it runs as a daemon and starts server processes on demand when a connection attempt to a port is made.

Different modes of operation are available that control how connections are handled. In *normal mode*, a server sends arbitrary data provided in template files as a basic means to emulate well-known protocols. Many automated attack tools will be fooled and continue with the attack dialog. A popular mode is the so-called *mirror mode* in which incoming connections are proxied back to the initiator. This trick eliminates the need for protocol emulation in many cases. A third mode, the *proxy mode*, allows forwarding of specific sessions to other systems, e.g., high-interaction honeypots.

## Plugins
A module API provides an easy way to write custom extensions that are dynamically loaded into the honeypot. Aarriving attack data is assembled to a so-called *attack string* that can be saved to files or a SQL database for manual investigation. Honeytrap comes with different plugins that run on these attack strings to extract additional information or emulate further actions. An example is the `httpDownload` module that extracts URL strings from attack data and invokes an external tool to automatically download respective resources.

# Installation
Installing honeytrap is fairly straight forward. Simply run the following commands in the source tree root directory:
```
apt-get install -y autoconf \
                       build-essential \
                       git \
                       iptables \
                       libcap2 \
                       libcap2-bin \
                       libnetfilter-queue1 \
                       libnetfilter-queue-dev \
                       libjson-c-dev \
                       libtool \
                       libpq5 \
                       libpq-dev \
                       netbase \
                       procps \
                       wget && \

autoreconf -vfi && \
    ./configure \
      --with-stream-mon=nfq \
      --with-logattacker \
      --with-logjson \
      --prefix=/opt/honeytrap && \
    make && \
    make install && \
    make clean && \
```

The parameter `--with-stream-mon` specifies how honeytrap should look for incoming connection attempts. On Linux, the preferred choicde is `--with-stream-mon=nfq`, which instructs honeytrap to capture packets using the `iptables NFQUEUE` feature. When using this feature, an iptables rule like the following puts incoming TCP-SYN segments in a queue where they can be picked up by honeytrap:
```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --m state --state NEW --dport 445 -j NFQUEUE
```
Make sure not to queue packets to other critical services. Please refer to the INSTALL file and to the output of `./configure --help` for further information.

# Running

`/opt/honeytrap/sbin/honeytrap -D -C honeytrap.conf -P honeytrap.pid -t 5 -u honeytrap -g honeytrap`

# An Example Attack
Here's a captured attack by old-school IRC bot spreading via the all time classic MS04-011 LSASS exploit and a rudimentary FTP service built into the malware.
